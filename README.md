## 🛠️ Setup Guide

Follow these steps to run it yourself:

---

### 1️⃣ Clone or Download

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Syed-Zidaan-Ahmad/Daily-To-Do-List.git
```

or download and extract the ZIP.

---

### 2️⃣ Run It Locally

- Open `index.html` in your browser  
- Add tasks, mark them done, delete when completed  
- Tasks will auto-save using local storage

---

## ✍️ Customization Tips

📝 **Change Colors / Theme**  
→ Edit `style.css` to modify colors, fonts, and spacing

🎯 **Add More Features**  
→ You can extend it to include due dates, categories, or priorities in `script.js`

---

## 🛡️ Privacy & Data Usage

✅ All data is stored **only** in your browser’s local storage  
✅ No external servers or third-party services are used  
✅ No tracking, no hidden analytics

---

###  Create Your Own Telegram Bot

1. Open Telegram and search for **BotFather**  
2. Start a chat and type:
   ```
   /newbot
   ```
3. Give your bot a **name** and a **username** (must end with `_bot`)  
4. BotFather will send you a **Bot Token** — save it somewhere safe  
   *(Example: `1234567890:ABCdefGhIJKlmNoPQRstuVWXyz`)*

---

### Get Your Telegram Chat ID

1. Search for **@userinfobot** in Telegram  
2. Start it, and it will show your **numeric Chat ID**  
   *(Example: `987654321`)*

---

### Edit the Script

- Open `script.js`  
- Find the section where `botToken` and `chatId` are defined (line no 8 and 9)
- Replace them with your values:

```javascript
const BOT_TOKEN = "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE";
const CHAT_ID = "YOUR_CHAT_ID_HERE";

## 🌐 Deployment

You can host this app **for free** on:

- GitHub Pages  
- Netlify  
- Vercel

Simply upload the files and your to-do list will be live instantly.
